String Class in java:
String class is used to hold and manipulate combination
of letters like numbers(12,12.3) characters(abc,dfe) and specials charters(!@#$%^)
String class belongs to java.lan package that's why we don't need to import this class
because all of the class in this package are atomically imported.
JDK(java)
Whenever you have to access the instance members(fields/methods) inside a static method or
outside of that class we need to create an instance of that class.
