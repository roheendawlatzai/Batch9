Recap:
Constructor
constructor is a special block of code that helps us initialize the instance fields/properties/variables
of a class
it is called automatically when we create an object of the class
While defining Constructors we do not mention the return type not even void
name of the constructor should be same as name of the class.
this
when we have the same name - to show Java what exctaly we need to use
this can be use with parentheses to call the current class constructor.
we use this to avoid code repetition.
===========================
inheritance in java is a mechanism/process that we can use to inherit properties and
methods from another class to avoid code duplication.
